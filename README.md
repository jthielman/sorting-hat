# Sorting Hat

## Description
A user may submit student names on this page and click a button to have them sorted into Hogwarts houses.  First, a welcome screen invites the user to click a button to start sorting.  Then a form appears, into which the user may type any name not already submitted.  When either the Sort button is clicked or the enter key depressed, a card is shown with the submitted name and a randomly selected house.  Sorted students may be expelled by clicking on their Expel button.
